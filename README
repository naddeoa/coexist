This respository houses the build/install script for Coexist (named coexist).
This README serves as an introduction to coexist using the sample application
found in examples/workoutlog.



---------------------------------------------------------
-- DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------------------------------------

Android SDK

  You must download and install the Android SDK, and the platform-tools/ and
  tools/ folders should be on your path (at least while using the coexist script).
  In particular, coexist needs to use the adb and android executables. You must
  also install Android 4.1 in the SDK, aka target 10, aka android-16.

---------------------------------------------------------
-- RELATED REPOSITORIES
---------------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/naddeoa/coexist-android.git

  The Android client code. For now, this is the only client implemented, but
  other clients will more or less be ports of this code.

https://github.com/naddeoa/coexist-server.git

  The server code. This is the PHP based code that serves as an API to 
  the coexist clients. 



---------------------------------------------------------
-- FILES
---------------------------------------------------------

./coexist

  A script that is used for downloading, compiling and configuring the
  various parts of Coexist.

./coexist.ini

  A sample settings file for Coexist. It contains all of the available
  configuration options with detailed comments. These values are read
  by the coexist script and used to configure / compile the various parts
  of coexist.

./examples/workoutlog/

  An entire sample project.

./examples/workoutlog/logo.png

  The icon of the sample project. It is declared as the icon in its 
  coexist.ini file.

./examples/workoutlog/notification.png

  The notification icon of the sample project. In Android, it can be seen
  in the notifications tray. It is declared as the notification icon in
  its coexist.ini file.

./examples/workoutlog/coexist.ini

  The project configuration. These contain sample values for each of the
  possible options. You will have to supply a username, password and 
  database name once you have some picked out (assuming you will be testing
  the project out).

./examples/workoutlog/ui/1/create.json

  This is json metamodel for version 1 of this application (because it is
  in the "1" folder). This tells the clients how to map UI forms to 
  database columns, and restricts the possible input of some fields (integer
  fields can only be integers, date fields can only be dates etc.)

./examples/workoutlog/sql/mysql/1/schema.sql

  This is the SQL to create the database on mysql clients. This happens to also
  be what I've used to build the database on the server, but that isn't yet
  automated. This project uses mysql (though other dbms are possible). Execute
  the typical mysql < sql/mysql/1/schema.sql to build the backend.

./examples/workoutlog/sql/sqlite/1/schema.sql

  This is the SQL to create the database on sqlite clients. This is what
  the Android client will be requesting from the API. You must have a schema
  defined for the current version. In this application, the current version is
  1 (because the coexist.ini file says so), so you must have a <dbms>/1/schema.sql
  file for every dbms you intent on using. If you are going to use Android, then
  you need a sqlite folder.
